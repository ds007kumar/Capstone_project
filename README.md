# Capstone Project- AIML

In this capstone project, the goal is to build a pneumonia detection system, to locate the position of inflammation in an image.  

This project explores the deep learning function in detecting pneumonia through computer vision using five convolutional neural network models. Our study enables to identify among the five models the best model to detect pneumonia.
The Mask R-CNN model is the best model based on the observations having a model evaluation metric of 0.4.
For future studies, adaptation of other convolutional neural network architectures like yolo, SSD architectures for pneumonia detection must be implemented and the optimization of hyper-parameters should also be considered to improve the accuracy of the model. These observations will help medical work force in their decision making for a real-time application of the use of more accurate model in detecting pneumonia and discover the potential of diagnosing pneumonia using deep learning models.
CONCLUSION
Future considerations: • Explore Resnet50, VGG19, Mask R-CNN with high number of epochs and fine tuning of hyperparameters • Explore other advanced techniques such as YOLO & SSD
